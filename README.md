==============================
Jared Bennett

# Prompt
## Problem
In  this  assignment,  you  will  implement  programs  that  output  an  optimum longest common subsequence of two strings that contain characters in A­Z.  
 
## Algorithms
You   should   create   programs   that   will   compute   an   optimum   longest common subsequence using the following algorithms.  
1.   The dynamic programming algorithm in section 15.4 
2.   The memoized version of the above algorithm. 

## Running the program
Your program will be test as follows:

`<executable-­‐name> <string1-­‐file-­‐name> <string2-­‐file-­‐name>`

Each  input  file  will  contain  a  string.  The  output,  to  standard  output,  should  be  an 
optimum longest common subsequence. Nothing else should be output. 

## Files
You should create a directory called hw2 on linprog. This directory should contain 
the following files, implementing the algorithm indicated by the file name. 
1. Dynamic.cpp 
2. Memoized.cpp 
3. Makefile:  The  makefile  for  this  assignment.  Typing  make  should  create  two executables named Dynamic and Memoized respectively.  
4. Discussion.pdf: This should be a pdf file that discusses the following. 1. A practical application from which your strings came, such as protein sequences. 2. A discussion of the relative performances of the two algorithms as a function of the sizes of the strings.  

  
## Submission procedure
Follow the homework submission instructions in the link from the syllabus. 

## Grading
You   will   be   graded   on   the   following:

1. correctness   of   your   code, 
2. performance  of  your  code
3. the  quality  of  your  discussion  (both,  presentation, and technical quality).

If your coding style is poor, then you may lose points.
